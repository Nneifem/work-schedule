# work-schedule

## Description

This project was made to a virtual hourly work schedule from 9am to 5pm of what the day will look like for the current day. It will help to keep everything organized and save money and paper as the it matches with your timezone so you will be up to date on things date and time wise. Creating this, I learned how to use jQuery within JavaScript and how to utilize localStorage in order to save the data when the page has been refreshed.


## Usage

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

When you open the web page you will see three sections in a row in the order of time, empty container, and a blue box with a save disk in the center. If you click in the empty container, you can type whatever you need to and in order to save that data in there, click on the blue box. So now when you refresh the page the text you entered will still be in that container.
